Device Data Processing Take-Home
Requirements
The task is to merge data from two JSON files containing data reported by IoT devices which capture 
temperature and humidity data. Each device uses a slightly different JSON schema.
Develop a business layer solution using C# & .NET Core that will process data from each file, summarize the data 
in to a single standardized list, and add some calculated values:
• Average temperature of each device
• Average humidity of each device
• Total record count for both temperature and humidity 
• First and Last time each device reported sensor values
Save the merged list to a new JSON file.
Create tests which pass and cover the application logic appropriately.
The structure of the merged list should be defined as:
 public int CompanyId { get; set; } // Foo1: PartnerId, Foo2: CompanyId
 public string CompanyName { get; set; } // Foo1: PartnerName, Foo2: Company
 public int? DeviceId { get; set; } // Foo1: Id, Foo2: DeviceID
 public string DeviceName { get; set; } // Foo1: Model, Foo2: Name
 public DateTime? FirstReadingDtm { get; set; } // Foo1: Trackers.Sensors.Crumbs, Foo2: Devices.SensorData
 public DateTime? LastReadingDtm { get; set; }
 public int? TemperatureCount { get; set; }
 public double? AverageTemperature { get; set; }
 public int? HumidityCount { get; set; }
 public double? AverageHumdity { get; set; }
Delivery
Upload the solution to a cloud storage and share the link. (GitHub, Azure DevOps Repo, OneDrive, Google Drive, 
Dropbox, etc.)
